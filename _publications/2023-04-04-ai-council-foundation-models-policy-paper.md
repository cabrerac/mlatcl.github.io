title: The UK foundation Models Opportunity
abstract: |
  In December 2022, the AI Council’s memo on the policy implications
  of advances in foundation models highlighted the importance of rapid
  Government action to build national capability in this increasingly
  important technology area. The memo noted the importance of seeking
  input from across industry, research, and civil society to examine
  options to build national capability, and to create an action plan
  to position the UK for international leadership. Responding to this
  need, a subgroup of the AI Council has convened to deliver this
  briefing on the UK foundation model opportunity, based on engagement
  across its networks within the UK and internationally. This subgroup
  was led by Neil Lawrence, in collaboration with Tabitha Goldstaub,
  Wendy Hall, Nick Jennings, and Marc Warner.
  
  This briefing note highlights two types of policy intervention
  required to position the UK for international leadership in
  foundation models:
  
  * Drive further progress delivering foundational AI policy
    frameworks: Progress in foundation models highlights the
    importance of establishing a policy infrastructure that enables
    the safe and effective development of AI, supports its adoption
    across sectors, and ensures all in society can have confidence in
    its use. The AI Roadmap and National AI Strategy provide a
    framework for progress.

  * Establish national capabilities to deliver core policy functions
    in relation to foundation models: These capabilities should
    provide a proving ground to assess the functionality and
    limitations of foundation models before deployment; develop
    protocols for responsible research and innovation; build private
    sector capability; encourage adoption in areas of high potential
    benefit; provide an infrastructure for open research and
    innovation; increase collaboration with allies internationally;
    and ensure the UK has access to cutting edge capabilities needed
    for national security.

  The Council has already established networks of expertise that
  Government can use to move quickly in developing its response to the
  opportunities and challenges presented by foundation models. Current
  interest in foundation models, coupled with the creation of the
  Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, provides an
  opportunity to establish an adaptive approach to AI policy, drawing
  from independent, expert advice that moves quickly to identify
  emerging issues, facilitate the development of policy responses, and
  support effective implementation. The AI Council can support
  Government in galvanising the community to deliver this progress,
  through both responding to rapid shifts in technical capabilities
  that demand near-term responses and building the UK’s AI ecosystem
  over the long-term.
