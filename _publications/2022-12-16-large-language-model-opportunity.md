title: The UK Large Language Models Opportunity
abstract: HMG should take action to build national and sovereign capability in Large Language Models, a type of Artificial Intelligence trained to analyse written language and generate convincing novel text. Without action to establish national capability, HMG risks handing the keys to a strategically significant technology to overseas companies, creating a technology gap that will expand over time and expose the UK to vulnerabilities across the public, private, and security sectors. The far reaching nature of LLMs means government needs to consider interventions in multiple parts of the ecosystem (commercial, academic, and otherwise) to deliver the scale of progress required. The AI Council stand ready to help to convene people around this important opportunity.
